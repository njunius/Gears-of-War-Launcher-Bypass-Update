This repository contains an updated default.htm file for use with the 2006 release of Gears of War for Windows when run through Lutris. The launcher does not fully render and must be bypassed for the game to function properly. It uses markup originally stored here: https://pastebin.com/raw/CyU6gZYg but merged into the original file rather than fully overwriting it to provide more consistent behavior on newer versions of WINE. This file is used in the alternative installer script for Gears of War on Lutris. It has been tested on Wine 10.13.
