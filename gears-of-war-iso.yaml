notes: "This is a modification of the original installer found on Lutris which bypasses GFWL entirely via xliveless and uses a version of the launcher bypass with more consistent behavior. The launcher bypass code from https://pastebin.com/raw/CyU6gZYg will not always succeed in bypassing the launcher. This version of the bypass can be found here: https://github.com/njunius/Gears-of-War-Launcher-Bypass-Update/raw/refs/heads/main/default.htm\nAdditional modifications to the original launcher are:\r\nThe inclusion of Xliveless as a potential safeguard of functionality.\r\nRunning the game during installation so the launcher directory is created in AppData as the original launcher would fail to create the directory on some systems.\r\nThe remomval of dependencies on the broken GFWL installer which would cause the original installation script to fail.\r\n\r\nThis version of the script has been tested on Wine 10.13 and using an ISO from the following archive.org page: https://archive.org/details/GOF1dvd"
